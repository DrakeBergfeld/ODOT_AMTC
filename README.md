Automatic Max Traffic Counter for ODOT Summer Internship 2023

This is a calculator that automatically sorts inputted traffic data and selects the range of which traffic was the highest.
Users have several different settings to gain differing results for the max count.

Both the counter and a sample set of data can be found in this repository.
